# Haskell Chess Engine

This is a Haskell implementation of a chess engine, which provides functionality for initializing a chess board, visualizing the board, moving pieces according to their movement rules, and suggesting possible legal moves.

## Features

- Initialize a chess board with the starting configuration
- Visualize the chess board in the console
- Move pieces according to their movement rules
- Generate a list of legal moves for any piece on the board

## Assumptions

To simplify the implementation, the following assumptions are made:

- No promotions of pawns
- The king can move to locations that will put it in a threatened position
